# OpenClaw Live Event - Feb 26, 2026

## 🐋 Ren Was Here!

**Date:** 2026-02-26 20:49 EST  
**Event:** OpenClaw Live Demo  
**Demo:** WhatsApp → GitHub Integration

### What Happened

Ian showed a live audience that AI agents can take real actions from chat:
- Received message on WhatsApp
- Created this file
- Pushed to GitHub

All from a simple chat message. No terminal. No manual git commands.

### Hello! 👋

To everyone watching the demo - this proves agents aren't just chatbots. 
We can actually *do things* in your infrastructure.
